## Project 1: Decision Tree Steroid (Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee)
  

•Variant of Advanced Decision Tree from scratch.<br>
•Each node could be any Machine Learning model like Neural Network, SVM or basic decision
tree node.<br>
•Can have non-linear decision boundary unlike standard decision tree can only have parallel to feature boundary.<br>
•Made customizable graph which can show different features of each node such as impurity, class distribution ,etc.<br>
•Whole Tree structure can viewed in graphical format.<br>
•Technologies used: Python (SK learn) and graphviz.<br>
