## Project 1: [D2l-PyTorch](https://github.com/dsgiitr/d2l-pytorch), Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee

```markdown
•Ported MXNet Code into Pytorch for the book Dive Into Deep Learning by Aston
Jhang et al.
•Converted the book to an interactive jupyter notebook format.
•Contributed and maintained d2l-pytorch on github (3000+ stars and 900+
forks).
•Technologies used: Python(Pytorch).
```

## Project 2: [Decision Tree Steroid](https://github.com/ankitaharwal/Decision_Tree-Steroid) (Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee)

```markdown
•Variant of Advanced Decision Tree from scratch.
•Each node could be any Machine Learning model like 
Neural Network, SVM or basic decision
tree node.
•Can have non-linear decision boundary unlike standard 
decision tree can only have parallel to feature boundary.
•Made customizable graph which can show different features 
of each node such as impurity, class distribution ,etc.
•Whole Tree structure can viewed in graphical format.
•Technologies used: Python (SK learn) and graphviz.
```

## Project 3: [Number plate Detection](https://github.com/dsgiitr/np_detection), Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee

```markdown
•Detect vehicles and record their number plates from CCTV camera for security
purpose.
•The system tracks vehicle then separates the number plate from the vehicle
(openCV) and outputs the digits (OCR) .
•Technologies used: Pytorch, openCV and YOLO.
