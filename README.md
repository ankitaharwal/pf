## Project 1: [Decision Tree Steroid](https://github.com/ankitaharwal/Decision_Tree-Steroid) (Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee)

```markdown
•Variant of Advanced Decision Tree from scratch.
•Each node could be any Machine Learning model like 
Neural Network, SVM or basic decision
tree node.
•Can have non-linear decision boundary unlike standard 
decision tree can only have parallel to feature boundary.
•Made customizable graph which can show different features 
of each node such as impurity, class distribution ,etc.
•Whole Tree structure can viewed in graphical format.
•Technologies used: Python (SK learn) and graphviz.
