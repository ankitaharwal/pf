## Project 2: [Decision Tree Steroid](https://github.com/ankitaharwal/Decision_Tree-Steroid) (Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee)
To verify this certificate visit: https://ecertificate.iitr.ac.in/verification/6694e25f-3ec0-48b7-a168-c469dfd30ed7

```markdown
•Variant of Advanced Decision Tree from scratch.
•Each node could be any Machine Learning model like 
Neural Network, SVM or basic decision
tree node.
•Can have non-linear decision boundary unlike standard 
decision tree can only have parallel to feature boundary.
•Made customizable graph which can show different features 
of each node such as impurity, class distribution ,etc.
•Whole Tree structure can viewed in graphical format.
•Technologies used: Python (SK learn) and graphviz.
```

## Project 3: [Number plate Detection](https://github.com/dsgiitr/np_detection), Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee
To verify this certificate visit: https://ecertificate.iitr.ac.in/verification/2c5c8c95-0dd6-4ab2-bed7-8e74ded1812d

```markdown
•Detect vehicles and record their number plates from CCTV camera for security
purpose.
•The system tracks vehicle then separates the number plate from the vehicle
(openCV) and outputs the digits (OCR) .
•Technologies used: Pytorch, openCV and YOLO.
